            your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
            collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling

            <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
            social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.

        </p>
        <p>
          Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
          media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we
          will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The
          profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned,
          but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
          well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
          Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please
          note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
          information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
          privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
          and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

            <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
            the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.

        </p>
        <p>
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
          purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
          permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in
          this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
          of time in which users have an account with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
          will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
          example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
          will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
          until deletion is possible.

        <p>
          We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
          despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
          over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,
          so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
          third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
          steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
          information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
          risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

          the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
          Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
          not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
          stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
          been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
          mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
          standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
          you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
          Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring
          DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

          Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make
          a request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not
          submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance
          with applicable laws.

        <h3>Request Verification</h3>

          same person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal
          information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
          request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
          maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes

          information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need
          to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
