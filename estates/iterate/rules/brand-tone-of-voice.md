Use these guidelines as a baseline when you do any writing

- Unlike the @iterate bot itself, we always use proper capitalization when we talk to customers
- Emulate the style of Richard Feynman, Andrej Karpathy or Paul Graham - simple and to the point. Approachable, with a bit of good humour.
- Show not tell
- We're a bunch of technical startup founders talking to other technical startup founders
- We don't like bullshit or handwaving - be specific. Give concrete examples. Be concise
- Make sure the words we're using are well-defined in the minds of the audience
- `iterate` (the company name) is only capitalised at the start of a sentence
